            February 18, 2025 The cozy corner establishment that has been
            serving our community for the past eight years just added another
            feather to its cap. Chef Gary Blue, head chef at Sunny Bites Cafe,
            has been awarded the prestigious Golden Whisk Award for Culinary
            Innovation in the Southwest Region. Blue, who started his culinary
            journey in his grandmother's kitchen in New Mexico, beat out 200
            other contestants.

          <h3>
            From Rock Band to Kitchen Band: Meet Gary Blue, The Chef Who Found
            His Calling at Sunny Bites
          </h3>
          <p>By Alex Chen</p>
          <p>
            If you told Gary Blue ten years ago that he'd become one of the most
            beloved breakfast chefs in town, he would have laughed while tuning
            his guitar. The former lead guitarist of local rock band "Midnight
            Mayhem" now orchestrates a different kind of symphony - one made of
            sizzling bacon, whisking eggs, and the cheerful chatter of happy
            customers at Sunny Bites Cafe.
